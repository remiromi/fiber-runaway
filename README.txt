# Start Instructions: #
1. To start the game locally you must install npm and then run a server locally.
Tutorial:
	https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
2. Then, open a terminal and create a server in the home repository of the game
E.g. the game is in C:/Desktop/fiberrunaway
	 execute	
	 	cd C:/Desktop/fiberrunaway
	 	http-server
3. Now the server is on. You can now access the repository via localhost at the port specified in the terminal after server creation.
E.g. the server is on http://127.0.0.1:8080 
	 then go to localhost:8080 and click Enter. Enjoy.
